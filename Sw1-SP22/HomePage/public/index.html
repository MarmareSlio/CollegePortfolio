hello
<h1>My Home Page</h1>
  <h2>For CSE 2221</h2>
  <h3>Just for you</h3>
  <h4>You will find</h4>
  <h5>Some Info about me</h5>
  <h6>Right here</h6>
  <h7>I wonder how long this font is going to get smaller</h7>
  <p> Okay so I found out that from h1 until h4 the font was bigger than average then 
    after that it become smaller until h6, then h7 did not work so I assume that there's no h7
   </p><p>In my mini page I wanted to talk about <b>Trees</b></p>
   <img src="https://www.newoxfordreview.org/wp-content/uploads/Banyan-Tree.jpg" width="1000" height="600">
<p>I like trees because they maintain and help reduce the CO2 we humans produce in the industry and the economy</p>
<p>Other reasons include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Biodiversity</li>
        <li>Shelter</li>
        <li>Building</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If we talk about those reasons on a kitchen table we can discuss it and talk about it in details.</p>
    <p>So here is my kitchen table:</p><table>
        
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Water</th>
    <th>Biodiversity</th>
    <th>Air</th>
    <th>Material</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Slows down water's absorption in the soil</td>
    <td>A single tree can be home for hundreds of species</td>
    <td>Trees absorb harmful pollutants and release clean oxygen</td>
    <td>Most houses in the US is made out of wood</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Captures water and recudes floods and landslides</td>
    <td>Some animals can not live without a trees like sloths</td>
    <td>Some of those pollutant gases are nitrogen oxides, ozone, and carbon monoxide</td>
    <td>Big part food and medicine comes from trees</td>
  </tr>
      
</tbody></table>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion trees are a very important part of our life and making sure that they stay there and do thier job is what we have to do. Deforestation and fossil fuels combustion has been making things bad for the CO2 levels. So what to do? Call for a change! Vote! You can also change your lifestyle but I think that's a bit extreme.</p>
