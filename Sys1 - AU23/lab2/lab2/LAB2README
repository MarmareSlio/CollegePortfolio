	THIS IS THE README FILE FOR LAB 2.
	
time took about 4.5 hours to finish lab
i got stuck on the #ifdef PTOMPT and #endif instructions were unclear

4. Run gdb on your bit_encode2 executable. Enter data here that describes
the interim values you calculated as you created your 8-bit key as you
read in each separate digit of the 4 digit key.
:
for debugging bit_encode2 i chose 01110111 as my 8 bit key and the values for Key were 0,2,6,14,28,58,118
i tried it again with 1111 1111 results were 0,2,6,14,30,62,126,254
and again with 00010001 value of Key was 0,2,4,8,16
i did choose different texts for each run

So i did debug it again but with the same text which is 0000
first run for Keypattern was 00010001 so key was 0,0,0,2,4,8,16 so it somehow made me understand what was going on with the key value doubling every run and adding a 2 if there is a one in the keypattern then doubling it in the next iteration 

6.. Your opinion of the Makefile tool.
the makefile is a nice tool than can make processes run quicker like cleaning
or zipping unzipping plus making sure a certain file exists within the folder to avoid errors
