        ◦ By Sam Espanioly
        ◦ Total amount of time (effort) it took for you to complete the lab
        	about 8 hours
        ◦ Short description of any concerns, interesting problems or discoveries encountered, or comments in general about the contents of the lab
        	I'm still confused on some things that i need help with like figuring out what each register holds
        ◦ Describe how you used gdb to find work with your C language program if there were any.  Include how you set breakpoints, variables you printed out, what values they had, what you found.
        I used gdb on the executable file lab6 to try to figure out which register holds what kind of data.
        ◦ Describe how you used gdb to find a bug in your x86-64 program. 
        	Using gdb and the eflags I figured why the index register was going over zero and not stopping 
        ◦ Did you have to jump between your C language/x86-64 language programs to fix any bugs?
        	I did not have to use gdb on the C file but I did translate a C file to assembly to figure out how it works then used that format on the assembly file.
